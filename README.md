Python Code for Cheking the Warranty Status on https://supportcommunity.zebra.com/s/warrantycheck?language=en_US

A friend of mine asked me if it was possible to check the warranty status of zebra printers without using the web interface. So I though why not.
Using BurpSuite I was able to capture the web request export it to python then write some code that grabbed the json output and printed it all nice and pretty.
